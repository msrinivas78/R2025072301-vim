# `vim.pot` is updated every time any of the *.c files are modified.  And as it
# contains line numbers for strings from *.c files, inserting a line into a
# single .c file may cause many lines in the `vim.pot` file to be updated.
#
# This generates a lot of "noise" in the diffs.  And especially considering that
# `vim.pot` is a generated file, looking at changes in this file is not useful.
#
# By marking it as binary we tell the git machinery that it should not be
# presented to the user in patches.

# GitHub reacts to the `linguist-generated` attribute, by ignoring marked files
# for the repository's language statistics and hiddning changes in these files
# by default in diffs.
