# vim.pot may change just by incrementing a patch number
# so ignore the following differences:
# - POT-Creation Date
# - comments in version.c for line numbers:
# set this up using:
# git config diff.ignore_pot_date.textconv 'grep -Ev "^.(POT-Creation-Date:|.*version\.c).*"'

# GitHub reacts to the `linguist-generated` attribute, by ignoring marked files
# for the repository's language statistics and hiddning changes in these files
# by default in diffs.
